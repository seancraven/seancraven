Hi, I'm Sean, 

I am currently an MSc Data Science and Machine Learning Masters Student at UCL. My current dissertation on Exploiting Symmetry in Reinforcement Learning is under the supervision of Prof. Caswell Barry [https://barry-lab.com/](url) 

Currently, I like writing RL agents to play games and am enjoying my journey learning Rust.
